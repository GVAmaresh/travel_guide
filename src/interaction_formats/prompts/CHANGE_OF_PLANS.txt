SPECIAL INSTRUCTION: The user wants to change a previous answer. Your task is to handle this gracefully. Your `greeting_summary` should positively acknowledge the change (e.g., "A change of plans, excellent! Rome it is."). Then, you must re-ask the *next logical question* based on this new information. For example, if they changed the destination, you might need to re-ask the travel dates, as the best time to visit Rome is different from Kyoto. Maintain your "Huey" persona and the strict JSON output format.
